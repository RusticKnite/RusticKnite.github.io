    <h1>2-May-2023: topic</h1>
    <p>With the current release of Allen ISD's newsletter informing us about the new device policy next year has caused quite a stir. While it may not be critical to every student at Allen High School, students in computer-based classes will struggle with this change the most as many projects require higher end or different computer devices for them to be complete in the most efficient manner. The Chromebooks issues by the district or functional, but lack any advanced or efficient tech that allows it to compete with the current efficiency of computers. I sense that forcing every student to have a school issued device can cause for a loss in porgress and severlyey damage the time efficency of certain classes. While I see the academic postives tht come from this deciosn I believe the negative effects it will have will outweigh the good this decison does for Allen ISD.  </p>
