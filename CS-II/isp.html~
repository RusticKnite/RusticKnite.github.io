<p class="isptxt"> My Isp project was a game that was based off the mechanics of pong, but came with a twist that it had a soccer theme and implented new rules and challenges based off that theme. The game is fully functional and made use of all aspects I've learned from computer science up to this point.</p>

      <div class="menu">
	Conclusion: I learned that even given an abundant amount of time, the combination of missions and the ISP took up a lot of time. We could have had better time management to add more additions to our game, but we are glad about how it turned out.
	Not only that, but we also learned the importance of teamwork, both of us worked very hard in and outside of school, trying to figure out many errors and adding new additions. We both enjoyed each other's company while working on this project together and learned a lot.
	We also have a new appreciation for coders all around the world because we learned how time-consuming and difficult it can be.

<p class="isptxt">Concept: We have made a game that follows the traditional game of soccer. It has similar concepts to pong with the scoring system, but other than that, the game is a pixel version of soccer.</p>

	Examples of Code and Explanation: Background.swift was filled with renders of images that are used in the background. InteractionLayer.swift is the section where we used to bring forth our images that we rendered, and we also show what keys are used to make the paddles move up or down. Plane.swift and flagRunner.swift are the same but with different images, which allow the plane or runner to go from the left of the screen to the right of the screen.
