  <h2>About My ISP Project:</h2>
<p     >Our ISP project is the classroom attendance facial recognition scanner. The product has the designed purpose of using facial recognition to make the school attendance process more efficient. Our product makes both use of software and hardware. Every teacher and student knows the struggle in taking attendance as well as the amount of time the pprocess takes. Our project aims to solve that problem and revamp today's classrooms and enviroment. We have a well diverse group that can work efficently to tackle more specialized problems. The hope for this product is to be highly effective and work towards a goal getting rid of the old attendance process entirely. It builds up the responsibility of the students as this process is similar to as if checking in for work. We want to make sure our facial recognition system is very complex to account for the realitity of the issues we may face. Howeger, I belive this project will be a major acomplishment for our group and there is a lot of commitment behind the project. Overall, this project has the hopes of being challenging, but very rewarding.</p>
