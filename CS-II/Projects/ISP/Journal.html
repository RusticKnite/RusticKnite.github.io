  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week we mostly researched and discussed our project moving forward. Through these discussions we identified later tech issues that we will run into and our solution for these problems. For example we had to decide whether we wanted it to scan faces by taking pictures manually each time someone scans there face or whether we wanted the camera to be constantly taking pictures trying to recognize a face making it more efficient and practical. We chose the second option, but we are aware that it would take a bit more coding and troubleshooting. However, we believe we are skilled enough to complete this task and we believe it is the best decision for our project. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> One of the major scheduling challenges this week is that school is starting to pick up to its normal pace again meaning we have to use time more wisely. It might prove difficult to balance the project and school work, but I believe if we all stay disciplined and manage our time efficiently we should be able to stay on schedule for the project. I know that school work will sometimes through us off task, but if we are able to get right back on we should be able to finish our project in no time. Other than that, our group has been pretty ahead of schedule for our project. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Again, I don't have any major complaints for my group and I believe we are all working at a satisfactory level. If I were to have one complaint it would be that there is a bit of a lack of communication. With a group of our size sometimes things are communicated correctly causing some confusion and time loss. If we were to be more attentive and aware as a group we would be able to work more in sync helping us be more time efficient. However, that is only a minor issue and I believe my team has been excellent so far. </p>

  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to it being pretty early into the project not many technical problems have raised. The main goal of this week was to set up the GitHub repository and created issues for our project. While some problems did occur when each member had to edit the README sometimes overriding each others edit, a bit of communication and understanding of GitHub fixed that problem quickly. We also had to make sure each group member could access and edit the repository. These challenges serve as a good warning for challenges in the future so that we can be more prepared and qualified to face them. I think a better understanding how how GitHub works and more practice with its features will help this aspect of the project run smoothly. That was most of the technology we used this week but it helps set the foundation for our project allowing us to work more efficiently next week.   </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week our scheduling problems became more apparent. The challenge derives from each group member having very different backgrounds and school schedule making a bit harder to communicate. This could slow the process and lead to things not getting done on time. However, even though it would be hard for the group to get together outside of class hours, the issue board, social media, and smaller group formations can be used to solve this issue and allow us to work with the same efficiency as if we were all together. Communication is vital for our project and is what a successful group thrives on. Other than that challenge, our planning and goals are all set for project and a schedule is in formation.  </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> For the most part my team worked efficiently and were satisfactory. However, our group has the tendency to be off topic and not on task. This issue may prove difficult to solve but I think it will become less of an issue once the ball is rolling and we can actually be engaged in our project. Some solutions to this problem is to make sure we have a detailed schedule that can keep people in check and makes sure we dint get behind on deadlines. But it would still have to be flexible so the casual group environment isn't destroyed. Fortunately, I believe that my team can overcome these challenges and the work efficiency will start to pick up drastically in the next couple of weeks.  </p>
