      <h2>10-Apr-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
      <p class="stx"> The challenge we faced this week was figuring out a method to where the facial recognition software could run live on the html page where the camera is hosted. This is one of the key parts of our website because it allows the user to see a live feed of attendance and monitor how the system is running. Currently, the method that is being looked into is a jinja loop which would allow for the whole system to run, but this is still in progress. Additionally, after we figure out this issue we need to connect it with the entire database interface/ A lot has been completed with this project, but there is still a good amount to do. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx">   Not that many scheduling issues this week other than we could increase our time efficiency, but even then we are working at a fine enough pace. Hopefully we can get the harder portions of the rest of the project done before it turns into exam weeks. We just have to keep pushing on and make sure that we don’t start slacking. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
      <p class="stx">  I didn’t experience any interpersonal challenges this week. Maybe if there was a bit more communication we could work better as a group. If we can communicate a little better our progress would improve. Other than that, we had a good week as a team and ran into no major issues. </p>

  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The technical challenges faced this week was integrating a working live camera with python on a flask server with HTML support. Currently I'm working on the interactive relation with SQL and Facial Recognition so that the software can update the attendance database. The challenge comes from HTML not supporting python code and not being able to change the language due to our server being exclusively python. However, we have come up with a workaround with flask that integrates the python code onto the HTML web browser. Hopefully, we will be able to implement this feature soon with progression. Overall, good progress was made this week and I'm satisfied with our progression.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> There weren't that many scheduling conflicts this week as we all relatively could pull our own weight on the project. Each one of us put good time and effort into the project and were able to keep up with the schedule. I just hope we can keep up with this level of proficiency and finish out strong in the upcoming weeks. Overall, this week was good for time and work ethic.  </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> I had no real issues with our group this week as we all worked relatively well. I feel that all of us are contributing well and we didn't have any personal conflicts. As long as we keep up good communication, I don't see us running into any interpersonal conflicts anytime soon. Overall, we did good as a group this week. </p>

  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Technical challenges that I faced this week was with the camera implementation on the front-end along with integrating flask with my work. While flask is a bit more complex it is vital for me to integrate into my working directory as it is needed in our more complex designs of our project. The camera situation is still ongoing, but significant progress was made. I will further implement more features and make sure that all factors will be integrated smoothly so they are release ready. Next week's focus may have to be on polishing up designs as a lot  of rough concepts have been made and need to be revised.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Problems that arose from scheduling was time management and having to deal with the large workload this week. Although really stressful, we just had to keep on moving forward because that is the only thing you can do in the these types of situations. We hope in the coming weeks things won't be as tense and time consuming and we can have a more positive and relaxed work enviorment with our project rather than a stressful one.  </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week we had some issues with work ethic. As we move closer towards the end of the year people have the tendency to slack more and be less productive. When we are less productive that cuts into valuable project time. Although it isn't a major decrease in productivity, I would like to see a bit more effort next week and a more positive attitude. Other than that, I have no complaints with how my group worked this week and I think we did good on our progress this week.</p>

  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The technical issues that we faced this week is trying to implement database and camera access onto the front-end. We have to use flask or python script in order to implement the code. Since we are that experienced in these areas it will take a bit of time and effort to implement. I believe we will be able to add this feature soon. Overall, we made great progress this week.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> There weren't many scheduling problems this week. We were on schedule with our plan and we worked efficiently. As we get further along in the upcoming months we need to stay focused and ready for any upcoming obstacles. I predict that in the following weeks as we enter into the final stretch of school, all of our schedules will be a lot more busy. Fortunately, if we work ahead now we don't have to be behind schedule later. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> No major issues with the team this week. Communication was great this week and work was done on schedule. The only thing we can do is to make sure we don't slip in or efficiency and to keep each other in line. Overall, the team has been functioning great as usual and there is little to no issues.</p>

  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The technical challenges we faced this week was just improving on and fixing previous code. This week was spent polishing and debugging what we have because we have good portion of the project almost complete. We hope to stay on task in order to boost efficiency and leave less work in the future. Next week we will try to integrate some designs together. Overall, there was not that many technical issues and we are working along with our schedule. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> There weren't many scheduling problems this week. All we had to do was make sure that we were at least working on something this week since we made great progress on the project over break. However, we'll make sure to kick it back again into our normal schedule next week. It is good for the group's health and productivity to allow downtime as they help prevent future scheduling and time related issues. Even with our slower pace, good work was still done.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Again, there were no major complaints with our group as we seem to work fine as usual. Therefore, we saw it as a good week ti build healthy group habits in order to maintain this period of zero conflicts. We hope that our improvement in communication skills will prove useful for the weeks to come. As usually there is always room for improvement, but there is nothing too pressing that can be fixed with time and communication.</p>

  <h2>27-Feb-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Our main technical challenge for this week was figuring out how to implement a live camera running the facial recognition software on our website. Normal python code can't be run on the web browser so we had to find a way to make our facial recognition work. Our solution is to use Python Scripts as it converts the code to Java Script which allows it work on the website. We hope to learn and implement this feature soon so we can continue on with our fronted design of the project. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> One of the difficult things about the schedule this week was the broken up school week. Due to testing and a half day it disoriented the group and made us less productive. However, we were able to come up with a improvised schedule to help us stay ahead of the project and keep us on task. This wasn't a major issue because were a bit ahead our projected schedule. Overall, good work was done this week, but nothing too significant was accomplished.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to it being so close to break and the quarter wrapping up, there was little motivation and productivity among the group. We decided that we can afford to take it easy this week as we are on great pace with the project and we have plans to work on the project over the break. While we aren't trying to overwork ourselves over the break, we realize that we will have downtime where we are given the perfect opportunity to work on the project. Overall, our group worked with little to no disagreements.</p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The technical challenges I faced this week was making sure that everyone was able to access the GitHub and make sure any git related issues were resolved. This required for me to be more informed on git commands and to be well-versed in git errors. It was a bit time consuming, but it was worth the time as it made the time it takes to modify the git significantly faster. As the project goes on the repository will hopefully become a more simpler and organized process. Overall, this week was very proficient for resolving issues. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to the school week being shortened it also shortened our in school work time. This forced us to work more efficiently and to assess the value in the order which we get tasks done. Fortunately we were able to get a good chunk of work done during our class time and this challenge was mostly overcome. However, we may need to adjust scheduling in order to account for short school weeks or busy weeks. Overall, although our schedule was slightly interrupted, we were still able to work in a time efficient manor.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Following the trends of previous weeks, there weren't many interpersonal challenges as are group has created a healthy workplace environment. If I had to pick the biggest problem of the week it would be trying to decide the color scheme of our website layout. Although the color scheme is a very important aspect in our project's design, a big chunk of time was taken by deciding on the scheme. Later in the future we will need to work on making sure our disagreements don't get too much in the way of the schedule. However, this wasn't a major problem in the grand scheme of things.</p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The technical challenges we faced this week was creating a landing page and an API. We wanted to create our base page for our website so we could be able to present a prototype of our project. We also have been testing and tinkering with an API, but there isn't too much concern because we don't have to implement our API until later into the project. Going forward, we plan to create a universal CSS file theme so that we can make the web page creating process way more time efficient. Overall, we made good process on our ISP. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week was a very heavy work week for everyone in the group. Due to this their was not much of a flow in work this week with people trying to get work in whenever they can. Fortunately, we were still able to stay in the time schedule, but our work flow has been disrupted. To fix this we will go right back to our normal work schedule and enforce a good time balance efficiency. Hopefully, the workload for us will lessen over the next couple of weeks. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> There wasn't any major interpersonal challenges face this week. Most of the issues I have mentioned, for the most part, have been resolved. If I were to make any suggestion is to just keep improving communication. But, I feel that we won't have any issue of achieving that. Overall, our group worked together and we all worked in a time efficient manner. </p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>06-Feb-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week's challenge was determining the overall integration of the facial recognition and designing the API. Much research must be done because we plan to make the attendance and face database dependent on the API. We divided up the work and tasks in order to achieve these goals and we hope to make great progress on the project. Overall, this week was great for identifying our next goals for the upcoming week. Hopefully, we can implement the landing page for our website soon. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The problem that we had this week is we had less time as group in person. Because of this, our group needs to work extra hard at bettering our communication so we can work the same as if we are together when we are separate. Yet, even with this problem it wasn't much of an issue at all. We also divided up the tasks for our next upcoming deadlines and goals. With our new management and work on certain aspects of the project, we hope to be ahead of schedule. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week I truly had no interpersonal challenges. While there was the occasional off topic productivity, our group was working with purpose and worked efficiently together. My hope is that we are able to keep up this level of work ethic in the upcoming weeks. It might be good to reinforce good habits like these so we can lessen the chance of interpersonal challenges in the future for our group. Overall, I was happy with our level of productivity. </p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>30-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week's challenge was determining the overall design of the website we will be using to run the project on. We had to determine the order, style, aspects, and features that we wanted to go into the site. We were able to make a rough concept and made some drafts on how the site will eventually look like. We are now able to move forward with are projects and have new goals of making our project more user friendly. We did great work on this concept. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The biggest problem this week is we had only one class together as a team due to bad weather conditions limiting our in-class contact. This caused problems in our efficiency and communication. However, we were still able to accomplish our tasks for this week so we are still on schedule. But, we didn't get much done after that. Hopefully next week we can pick up the speed again and work with better efficiency. Other than that, our group did good in this category. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to the bad weather conditions, there was little communication in our group. This lead to inconsistent timing and fluctuating efficiency. However, I don't see this as a major issue because this is a rare unexpected occurrence that affected our group meaning there is no need of worrying for these issues to happen again. Still, we will still be cautious on not wasting time and slacking on the project. Overall, are group still managed work with the schedule and we had no severe problems this week. </p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week we implemented our first version of the facial recognition aspect of the project. For the most part things worked accordingly. The challenges now are on how we can enhance the performance and accuracy of the facial recognition. Also we want to make it more advanced so it can work even in non-optimal conditions. I believe my group can achieve these goals and I believe we will be able to create a project that we are satisfied with the results. We also have to troubleshoot more and look for any bugs in the recognition. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week has been a very busy week with being occupied with other tasks in class and everyone having a busy schedule. However, we were able to communicate effectively and keep each other updated on the progression of the project. However, if we instate a loose schedule foundation we would be able to work in a more uniform pattern rather than big work done in randoms chunks of time. Overall, we were able to overcome our over-scheduling problem and we intend to keep the same amount of efficiency. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week had little to none interpersonal challenges. However, future challenges may arise from complacency of working so well. We will have to make sure that every team member is happy with there situation and how they are working with the other group members. Making sure we have a healthy work environment is key to having a successful ISP. I'm proud of the work accomplished by my team and I'm looking forward to what we will tackle in the future. </p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week we mostly researched and discussed our project moving forward. Through these discussions we identified later tech issues that we will run into and our solution for these problems. For example we had to decide whether we wanted it to scan faces by taking pictures manually each time someone scans there face or whether we wanted the camera to be constantly taking pictures trying to recognize a face making it more efficient and practical. We chose the second option, but we are aware that it would take a bit more coding and troubleshooting. However, we believe we are skilled enough to complete this task and we believe it is the best decision for our project. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> One of the major scheduling challenges this week is that school is starting to pick up to its normal pace again meaning we have to use time more wisely. It might prove difficult to balance the project and school work, but I believe if we all stay disciplined and manage our time efficiently we should be able to stay on schedule for the project. I know that school work will sometimes through us off task, but if we are able to get right back on we should be able to finish our project in no time. Other than that, our group has been pretty ahead of schedule for our project. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Again, I don't have any major complaints for my group and I believe we are all working at a satisfactory level. If I were to have one complaint it would be that there is a bit of a lack of communication. With a group of our size sometimes things are communicated correctly causing some confusion and time loss. If we were to be more attentive and aware as a group we would be able to work more in sync helping us be more time efficient. However, that is only a minor issue and I believe my team has been excellent so far. </p>
</div>
<div class="segmentAlt">
  <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to it being pretty early into the project not many technical problems have raised. The main goal of this week was to set up the GitHub repository and created issues for our project. While some problems did occur when each member had to edit the README sometimes overriding each others edit, a bit of communication and understanding of GitHub fixed that problem quickly. We also had to make sure each group member could access and edit the repository. These challenges serve as a good warning for challenges in the future so that we can be more prepared and qualified to face them. I think a better understanding how how GitHub works and more practice with its features will help this aspect of the project run smoothly. That was most of the technology we used this week but it helps set the foundation for our project allowing us to work more efficiently next week.   </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week our scheduling problems became more apparent. The challenge derives from each group member having very different backgrounds and school schedule making a bit harder to communicate. This could slow the process and lead to things not getting done on time. However, even though it would be hard for the group to get together outside of class hours, the issue board, social media, and smaller group formations can be used to solve this issue and allow us to work with the same efficiency as if we were all together. Communication is vital for our project and is what a successful group thrives on. Other than that challenge, our planning and goals are all set for project and a schedule is in formation.  </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> For the most part my team worked efficiently and were satisfactory. However, our group has the tendency to be off topic and not on task. This issue may prove difficult to solve but I think it will become less of an issue once the ball is rolling and we can actually be engaged in our project. Some solutions to this problem is to make sure we have a detailed schedule that can keep people in check and makes sure we dint get behind on deadlines. But it would still have to be flexible so the casual group environment isn't destroyed. Fortunately, I believe that my team can overcome these challenges and the work efficiency will start to pick up drastically in the next couple of weeks.  </p>
