  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week's challenge was determining the overall integration of the facial recognition and designing the API. Much research must be done because we plan to make the attendance and face database dependent on the API. We divided up the work and tasks in order to achieve these goals and we hope to make great progress on the project. Overall, this week was great for identifying our next goals for the upcoming week. Hopefully, we can implement the landing page for our website soon. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The problem that we had this week is we had less time as group in person. Because of this, our group needs to work extra hard at bettering our communication so we can work the same as if we are together when we are separate. Yet, even with this problem it wasn't much of an issue at all. We also divided up the tasks for our next upcoming deadlines and goals. With our new management and work on certain aspects of the project, we hope to be ahead of schedule. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week I truly had no interpersonal challenges. While there was the occasional off topic productivity, our group was working with purpose and worked efficiently together. My hope is that we are able to keep up this level of work ethic in the upcoming weeks. It might be good to reinforce good habits like these so we can lessen the chance of interpersonal challenges in the future for our group. Overall, I was happy with our level of productivity. </p>

  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week's challenge was determining the overall design of the website we will be using to run the project on. We had to determine the order, style, aspects, and features that we wanted to go into the site. We were able to make a rough concept and made some drafts on how the site will eventually look like. We are now able to move forward with are projects and have new goals of making our project more user friendly. We did great work on this concept. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> The biggest problem this week is we had only one class together as a team due to bad weather conditions limiting our in-class contact. This caused problems in our efficiency and communication. However, we were still able to accomplish our tasks for this week so we are still on schedule. But, we didn't get much done after that. Hopefully next week we can pick up the speed again and work with better efficiency. Other than that, our group did good in this category. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to the bad weather conditions, there was little communication in our group. This lead to inconsistent timing and fluctuating efficiency. However, I don't see this as a major issue because this is a rare unexpected occurrence that affected our group meaning there is no need of worrying for these issues to happen again. Still, we will still be cautious on not wasting time and slacking on the project. Overall, are group still managed work with the schedule and we had no severe problems this week. </p>

  <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week we implemented our first version of the facial recognition aspect of the project. For the most part things worked accordingly. The challenges now are on how we can enhance the performance and accuracy of the facial recognition. Also we want to make it more advanced so it can work even in non-optimal conditions. I believe my group can achieve these goals and I believe we will be able to create a project that we are satisfied with the results. We also have to troubleshoot more and look for any bugs in the recognition. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week has been a very busy week with being occupied with other tasks in class and everyone having a busy schedule. However, we were able to communicate effectively and keep each other updated on the progression of the project. However, if we instate a loose schedule foundation we would be able to work in a more uniform pattern rather than big work done in randoms chunks of time. Overall, we were able to overcome our over-scheduling problem and we intend to keep the same amount of efficiency. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week had little to none interpersonal challenges. However, future challenges may arise from complacency of working so well. We will have to make sure that every team member is happy with there situation and how they are working with the other group members. Making sure we have a healthy work environment is key to having a successful ISP. I'm proud of the work accomplished by my team and I'm looking forward to what we will tackle in the future. </p>

  <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week we mostly researched and discussed our project moving forward. Through these discussions we identified later tech issues that we will run into and our solution for these problems. For example we had to decide whether we wanted it to scan faces by taking pictures manually each time someone scans there face or whether we wanted the camera to be constantly taking pictures trying to recognize a face making it more efficient and practical. We chose the second option, but we are aware that it would take a bit more coding and troubleshooting. However, we believe we are skilled enough to complete this task and we believe it is the best decision for our project. </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> One of the major scheduling challenges this week is that school is starting to pick up to its normal pace again meaning we have to use time more wisely. It might prove difficult to balance the project and school work, but I believe if we all stay disciplined and manage our time efficiently we should be able to stay on schedule for the project. I know that school work will sometimes through us off task, but if we are able to get right back on we should be able to finish our project in no time. Other than that, our group has been pretty ahead of schedule for our project. </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Again, I don't have any major complaints for my group and I believe we are all working at a satisfactory level. If I were to have one complaint it would be that there is a bit of a lack of communication. With a group of our size sometimes things are communicated correctly causing some confusion and time loss. If we were to be more attentive and aware as a group we would be able to work more in sync helping us be more time efficient. However, that is only a minor issue and I believe my team has been excellent so far. </p>

  <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
  <p class="stx"> Due to it being pretty early into the project not many technical problems have raised. The main goal of this week was to set up the GitHub repository and created issues for our project. While some problems did occur when each member had to edit the README sometimes overriding each others edit, a bit of communication and understanding of GitHub fixed that problem quickly. We also had to make sure each group member could access and edit the repository. These challenges serve as a good warning for challenges in the future so that we can be more prepared and qualified to face them. I think a better understanding how how GitHub works and more practice with its features will help this aspect of the project run smoothly. That was most of the technology we used this week but it helps set the foundation for our project allowing us to work more efficiently next week.   </p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> This week our scheduling problems became more apparent. The challenge derives from each group member having very different backgrounds and school schedule making a bit harder to communicate. This could slow the process and lead to things not getting done on time. However, even though it would be hard for the group to get together outside of class hours, the issue board, social media, and smaller group formations can be used to solve this issue and allow us to work with the same efficiency as if we were all together. Communication is vital for our project and is what a successful group thrives on. Other than that challenge, our planning and goals are all set for project and a schedule is in formation.  </p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p class="stx"> For the most part my team worked efficiently and were satisfactory. However, our group has the tendency to be off topic and not on task. This issue may prove difficult to solve but I think it will become less of an issue once the ball is rolling and we can actually be engaged in our project. Some solutions to this problem is to make sure we have a detailed schedule that can keep people in check and makes sure we dint get behind on deadlines. But it would still have to be flexible so the casual group environment isn't destroyed. Fortunately, I believe that my team can overcome these challenges and the work efficiency will start to pick up drastically in the next couple of weeks.  </p>
