	  <h2>Problem & Solution</h2>
	  <h5>Identifies a problem and a solution there is a market for.</h5>
	  <p>People often have a difficult time staying focussed and awake during important activities such as learning or driving.</p>
	  <p> The product developed by our group will aid in keeping the user awake in times of need. Firstly, DX3 works to track the user’s face and facial expressions. By tracking the user’s eyes, DX3 can determine how long the user is closing their eyes. If the user’s eyes are closed for an extended period of time, DDD can detect that the user has become drowsy and is falling asleep. Then, DX3 can activate and help awaken the user with a user-chosen deterrent. Deterrents range from music, sirens, a small vibration, or a small electric shock. DX3 determines that the user is awake where it then returns to a stand-by mode.</p>
	  <p> *optional* If the user is repeatedly falling asleep, DX3 prompts them to brew a cup of coffee. If the user accepts either through voice command, button, or mobile app, DDD produces coffee.</p>

	  <h2>Mliestones</h2>
	  <h5>Major achievements of project and intended goals.</h5>
	  <p>The first milestone is to make a beta version of the app that works and is in align with our goal.

	  <h3>Marketing Activities</h3>
<h5>How we will get the project known</h5>
	  <p>Google ads - Recently trends have showed that in website video stream ads preform worse than static ads that appears on the border of websites. To utilize google ads we must create a visually appealing add that isn’t too flashy but persuasive enough to increase click rate.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    TikTok ads - After assessing the marketing and ads that go into tiktok, the most profitable method would be through sponsoring and authenticity while also making an account that has an influential platform. Products tend to do better when a consumer can not only be fond of the product, but also the company behind it.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Instagram ads - People love to support student led projects and business and like to be updated on what is happening with them currently. Instagram could provide as the medium for that as we can document the creative process also give a behind the scenes detail about the group and the project. This builds a more committed consumer base and tends to gain attraction with others taking inspiration from a successful group.

	  <h3>Target Market</h3>
	  <p>Students - A student doing homework or one that needs assistance staying awake in class could use the product.
<br>
<br>
Teacher - Teachers could use the product to keep their students awake
<br>
<br>
Truckers - Driving long distances can be tiring, so this product could help them push through the long nights
<br>
<br>
Night security guard - Many guards go into a state of a hallusive auto pilot because they follow a constant routine that is not only physically draining, but also mentally exhausting. Additionally, there is alot of downtime in jobs like these where one could easily fall asleep. Our product could help break trance and keep them distracted from going back into that trance.

	  <h3>Competition</h3>
	  <p>Apps such as Awake, Stay Awake, and Driver alarm are products that serve a very similar purpose except they are more focused on drowsy driving. But the drawbacks to there products are some don’t even use facial recognition, much of there software is outdated and buggy, and the apps don’t over a good enough stimulant or incentive to stay awake.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    DX3 will be different from our competitors because not only will we make a physical/auidtory stimulant to keep our users awake, we will also provide incentives and helpful tips on what to do to prevent drowsiness. Many apps with smiliar premises only scratch the surface, while DX3 will hit the ground running.
	  </p>

	<div class="card">
	  <h3>Revenue Streams</h3>
	  <p>DX3 will sell directly to customers from an online page and/or amazon page.
	    Our online page will contain information about our product, a place for customer feedback, help and a FAQ, along with much more information. To have a successful launch a marketing campaign or general ad promotion would help make our product more successful.
