    <h1>AI: The Key To Our Future</h1>
    <p>
      Technology is always improving, adapting, inventing, and enhancing our lives. One of those ways is through AI technology. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. AI is very presociety. It can be whether it is a chat bot, an image generator, an authenticator, or something as simple as a chess player. Regardless of the form it takes, we are surrounded by AI technology. One of the main goals of AI is to constantly learn and improve. Therefore, what is stopping AI from solving more challenging problems like a cure to cancer or a solution to global warming? AI will lead to a utopia for humans because AI can help come up with solutions to disease and the environment. AI can improve the condition of certain job fields and enhance efficiency.

      AI has already proven to be able to tackle problems such as disease and the environment. Kevin Roose (2022) describes how DeepMind’s AI, AlphaFold, used a deep neural network to predict the structure of the protein which solved the protein folding problem that molecular biologists struggled to resolve for decades (pg. 4). Because AI uses advanced software and a highly sophisticated problem-solving system, it is capable of producing solutions that even the smartest person could not achieve. AI is crucial in tackling our current problems in modern society. This is because many of the problems call for complex thinking and need the use of technology for it to be solved. To think, just in the near future, AI can help develop the medical field enough that it could be able to cure certain diseases, diseases. This is something have been able to do without AI. Another way AI could be beneficial to us is that it can help preserve our environment. “According to a recent BCG study, companies can now use AI to monitor their emissions and predict their future emissions to make effective, cost-efficient adjustments,” (Gonzalez 2022). AI can help save our planet from pollution and global warming by helping us limit our waste and predict disaster before it happens. This can be monumental for our society because global warming is a major problem that we are facing, but AI can easily make that problem futile. Overall, AI can take us one step closer to a society where the environment and disease are the least of our concerns.

      AI can also better our lives in our job fields. According to Kevin Roose (2022), large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 are being used to write screenplays, compose marketing emails and develop video games,” (pg. 5) AI is helping improve jobs by making them more reliable and time efficient. Many people argue that AI is taking over the job field, but in many ways, AI has enhanced the job field to a higher level. When we can work with AI we can create a new standard of working and redefine the modern work system as a whole. Allowing AI to work on the little tasks allows us as people to work on big-picture ideas. AI’s goal was never to replace or take over anything, rather its true purpose is to assist and to help. Another example of AI helping in the workplace is AI has started being able to help code like with Github’s copilot program, which helps finish segments of code saving programmers lots of time (Roose 2022). Advanced prediction software allows for AI to accurately complete segments of unfinished work, which essentially cuts work time in half. Eventually, AI can be capable of doing a job entirely. This may seem bad at first, but this would allow for the creation of job fields that support our ever-expanding future. Especially it creates a demand in the AI industry itself. According to Kristina "The lack of well-trained professionals who can build and direct a company’s AI and digital transformation journeys noticeably hinders progress and continues to be a major hurdle for businesses,” (2021). This opens up an opportunity for people who are in less skilled jobs to go into AI fields to help advance it further. This helps create a constant cycle of improvement in artificial intelligence and better job positions.  In the end, AI has the potential to create a future that can make our jobs and lives a bit easier.

      The only way to go is up when it comes to AI. We shouldn't be scared or concerned about it, rather we should be hopeful and accepting of it. AI has the potential to be the gateway to a brighter future. Whether it is through fixing our environment or expanding the workforce, AI is making a positive impact on our society. However, it is our job to accept artificial intelligence and we have to be willing to learn and grow with it. If we can move forward together through this development we would be able to advance beyond what we can comprehend as a society. Yet, no matter what I say the only person who can make that decison is you yourself alone. So I ask you this question, are you ready for the future that is AI?
