    <h1>AI: The Key To Our Future</h1>
    <p>
      Technology is always improving, adapting, inventing, and enhancing our lives. One of those ways is through AI technology. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. AI is very presociety. It can be whether it is a chat bot, an image generator, an authenticator, or something as simple as a chess player. Regardless of the form it takes, we are surrounded by AI technology. One of the main goals of AI is to constantly learn and improve. Therefore, what is stopping AI from solving more challenging problems like a cure to cancer or a solution to global warming? AI will lead to a utopia for humans because AI can help come up with solutions to disease and the environment. AI can improve the condition of certain job fields and enhance efficiency.

      AI has already proven to be able to tackle problems such as disease and the environment. Kevin Roose (2022) describes how DeepMind’s AI, AlphaFold, used a deep neural network to predict the structure of the protein which solved the protein folding problem that molecular biologists struggled to resolve for decades (pg. 4). Because AI uses advanced software and a highly sophisticated problem-solving system, it is capable of producing solutions that even the smartest person could not achieve. AI is crucial in tackling our current problems in modern society. This is because many of the problems call for complex thinking and need the use of technology for it to be solved. To think, just in the near future, AI can help develop the medical field enough that it could be able to cure certain diseases, diseases. This is something have been able to do without AI. Another way AI could be beneficial to us is that it can help preserve our environment. “According to a recent BCG study, companies can now use AI to monitor their emissions and predict their future emissions to make effective, cost-efficient adjustments,” (Gonzalez 2022). AI can help save our planet from pollution and global warming by helping us limit our waste and predict disaster before it happens. This can be monumental for our society because global warming is a major problem that we are facing, but AI can easily make that problem futile. Overall, AI can take us one step closer to a society where the environment and disease are the least of our concerns.
